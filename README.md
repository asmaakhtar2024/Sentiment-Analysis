# Sentiment-Analysis
This project's objective is to find gyms in a specific location, such Jersey City, New Jersey, using the Yelp API. It retrieves reviews for each gym, performs sentiment analysis using Textblob and NaiveBayesAnalyzer, and then performs a variety of tasks, such as cleaning the text of the reviews, searching for stopwords, and sorting and listing the top 5 gyms based on the positive sentiment, in order to answer the project's question. Furthermore, a word cloud based on the most often used nonstop phrases has been included. Furthermore, the labels for the analysis based on Textblob and NaiveBayesAnalyzer are displayed in a donut chart.
